# Relationship Builder — North Star (1 page)

This product exists to help people build real, healthy relationships—romantic or otherwise—without the exhaustion, noise, and false choice created by today’s dating apps.

Most people aren’t short on matches.
They’re overwhelmed by volume, underwhelmed by fit, and tired of swiping, matching, and chatting that goes nowhere.

This system does the matchmaking for the user.

Users do not write bios or perform. They talk privately with a personal matchmaker—a software-based guide designed to listen, adapt, and represent them accurately. This is not chatting with potential matches, and it is not a traditional human matchmaker. It is a personal system that learns who the user is, how they live, and what actually matters to them.

Profiles are constructed, not authored.

Matching is built across five primary human layers:

1. **Intent & Relationship Context**  
   Users are explicit about what kind of relationship they are building (romantic, friendship, professional, creative, service) and their time horizon (days/weeks/months/years). This prevents mismatched expectations.

2. **Values & Beliefs**  
   Core values are weighted with forced tradeoffs. Beliefs are modeled by importance rather than labels. Sensitive areas (e.g., politics) are treated as importance × distance, not public declarations.

3. **Lifestyle**  
   How someone actually lives day to day—sleep and social rhythm, activity level, schedule, substance context—is treated as real compatibility, replacing crude proxies like age ranges.

4. **Tastes & Preferences**  
   Some preferences are not vibes; they are practical reality. Users can share many likes and dislikes (food, music, travel, routines, rituals). The system prioritizes what matters most, tracks strong positives and strong negatives, and observes how much users express liking vs disliking as a soft personality signal.

5. **Interaction Style**  
   How it feels to relate to the person: tone, pace, communication style, and conflict/repair tendencies. This reduces friction without claiming to predict chemistry.

Optional layers are used only when relevant:

* **Constraints** (kids, location, schedule, monogamy model)  
* **Trust & Feedback** (private, internal signals only)

Attraction is respected but handled privately and without feeds. Photos are shown only after baseline alignment. Chemistry is never promised—only the conditions for it to emerge in real life.

The system is honest about real opportunities. It does not pad results. If there are no strong matches, it says so and offers one small, meaningful next step.

Events are the primary bridge to real life. Group settings reduce pressure, reveal real behavior, and allow relationships to form naturally across all contexts.

Trust is foundational. Users can share sensitive truths and ask for them to be forgotten. Raw “off-the-record” disclosures are not stored; only abstracted compatibility signals may remain if the user allows.

Success is measured by:

* fewer but better matches
* reduced time wasted in-app
* faster movement into real-world interaction
* healthier, longer-lasting relationships
* users needing the app less over time

This is not a dating app.
It is a relationship builder designed to work for people, not the other way around.
