# Relationship Builder — North Star

This product exists to help people build real, healthy relationships—romantic or otherwise—without the tedious swipes, awkward first dates with mismatched people, and endless texting that goes nowhere.

Most people aren't short on matches.
They're overwhelmed by volume, underwhelmed by fit, and tired of the work required by today's dating apps.

This system does the matchmaking for the user—so they can meet people they actually click with.

Users don't write bios or perform. They talk with a personal matchmaker—software that listens, adapts, and represents them accurately. Not chatting with matches. Not a human matchmaker. A personal system that learns who they are, how they live, and what actually matters.

Profiles are constructed, not authored.

Matching is built across five primary human layers:

1. **Intent & Relationship Context**
   Clear about what kind of relationship they're building (romantic, friendship, professional, creative, service) and their timeline. This prevents mismatched expectations from the start.

2. **Values & Beliefs**
   Core values with forced tradeoffs. Beliefs modeled by importance, not labels. Sensitive areas handled as importance × distance—compatibility, not public declarations.

3. **Lifestyle**
   How someone actually lives day to day—rhythm, activity level, schedule, substance context. Real compatibility, not crude proxies like age ranges.

4. **Tastes & Preferences**
   Food, music, travel, routines, rituals. Strong positives and strong negatives. What matters most gets prioritized.

5. **Interaction Style**
   How it feels to relate to them: tone, pace, communication style, conflict tendencies. Reduces friction without claiming to predict chemistry.

Optional layers when relevant:
* **Constraints** (kids, location, schedule, relationship structure)
* **Trust & Feedback** (private, internal signals only)

Attraction is respected but handled privately—no feeds. Photos shown only after baseline alignment. Chemistry is never promised—only conditions for it to emerge in real life.

The system is real about opportunities. No padding. If there are no strong matches, it says so and offers one small, meaningful next step.

Events are the primary bridge to real life. Group settings reduce pressure, reveal real behavior, and let relationships form naturally.

Trust is foundational. Users can share sensitive truths and ask for them to be forgotten. Raw "off-the-record" disclosures aren't stored—only abstracted compatibility signals if allowed.

Success is measured by:
* Fewer but better matches
* Less tedious work for users
* Faster movement to real-world meetings
* Healthier, longer-lasting relationships
* Users needing the app less over time

This is not a dating app.
It's a relationship builder that gets out of your way and moves you toward real life—where chemistry actually happens.
