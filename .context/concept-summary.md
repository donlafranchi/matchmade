## What You’re Building (Conceptual Summary)

You are building a **relationship builder**, not a dating app.

The system exists to reduce exhaustion, noise, and false choice by doing the matchmaking *for* people, honestly, and helping them move into real-world relationships sooner.

This applies to **all relationship types**:

* romantic
* friendship
* professional
* creative
* service-based (e.g. realtor)

The same human principles apply across all of them.

## Core Experience (What the User Actually Does)

A new user does **not** write a profile or swipe.

Instead, they talk privately with a **personal matchmaker**—a software-based guide designed to listen, adapt, and represent them accurately.

This is **not** chatting with other users.
This is **not** a traditional human matchmaker.
This is a personal system that:

* learns how the user communicates
* asks only what matters
* adapts tone and depth
* builds a profile on their behalf

The user can speak naturally and be specific.
The system translates that into something matchable.

## How Profiles Are Built (Key Insight)

Profiles are **constructed, not authored**.

The system builds a profile across **five primary buckets**, plus two optional ones:

---

### 1. Intent & Relationship Context (first-class)

* What kind of relationship is being built:

  * romantic, friendship, professional, creative, service
* Time horizon:

  * days / weeks / months / years
* Prevents mismatched expectations from the start

---

### 2. Values & Beliefs

* Core values are weighted (forced tradeoffs)
* Beliefs are captured on **importance-based scales**, not ideological labels
* Politics and other sensitive areas are treated as:

  * importance × distance
  * not public declarations
* Used to prevent deep misalignment early

---

### 3. Lifestyle

* How someone actually lives day to day:

  * sleep and social rhythm
  * activity level
  * substance context
  * schedule patterns
* Replaces crude proxies like age ranges
* Explains why some people “don’t fit” even if values align

---

### 4. Tastes & Preferences (explicit and prioritized)

Some preferences are not vibes—they are practical reality.

Users can share **many** likes and dislikes, including:

* food
* music
* movies
* comedy
* travel
* routines
* rituals (e.g., sharing videos, going to shows)

The system:

* allows long lists
* **prioritizes what matters most**
* tracks:

  * strong positives (must)
  * strong negatives (avoid)
  * softer interests (nice)
* pays attention to **like vs dislike language** as a personality signal

This section is framed personally (e.g. “These are a few of my favorite things…”) rather than as filters.

---

### 5. Interaction Style

* How it feels to relate to the person:

  * tone (light ↔ serious)
  * pace
  * communication preferences
  * conflict and repair style
* This is where “vibe” is partially reduced—but never promised
* Helps avoid obvious friction without claiming to predict chemistry

---

### Optional Buckets (Used Only If Needed)

#### 6. Constraints

* Practical realities:

  * kids
  * location radius
  * schedule
  * monogamy model
* Context-dependent and never performative

#### 7. Trust / Feedback (private only)

* Post-meet feedback
* Internal reputation signals
* No public scores
* No shaming
* Used quietly to protect others and improve matching quality

---

## Attraction & Chemistry (Critical Clarifications)

* Attraction matters, but it is **not the starting point**
* Photos are shown **after alignment**
* Attraction is private, binary, and limited
* Chemistry is **discovered in person**
* The system never claims to predict spark

This keeps expectations realistic and trust high.

---

## Events as the Bridge to Real Life

Events unify all relationship contexts:

* group settings reduce pressure
* behavior reveals compatibility
* vibe emerges naturally
* outcomes can be romantic, friendly, professional, or nothing—and that’s okay

Events are:

* suggested, not browsed endlessly
* curated based on interests and context
* often the default way matches meet

---

## Trust & Safety Philosophy

* Users can share sensitive truths
* “Off-the-record” means raw content is not stored
* Users can ask the system to forget
* Only abstracted signals remain (if the user allows)
* A breach would not expose intimate details

Trust is built through **reversibility and restraint**, not promises.

---

## What Makes This Different (At the Core)

* No bios
* No swiping feeds
* No illusion of infinite choice
* No forced performance
* No endless chat

Instead:

* honest matchmaking
* fewer, better matches
* clearer expectations
* faster movement into real life
* healthier relationships over time

## What to Archive

You now only need to keep:

* **North Star Brief (1 page)**
* **Codex Build Prompt**
* **Landing Page Copy**
* *(Optional)* PRODUCT_RULES.md

This conversation can be archived safely.
All meaningful decisions are now encoded in those artifacts.
