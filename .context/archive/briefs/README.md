# Briefs Directory

**Status:** Consolidated into roadmap
**Date:** 2025-12-27

---

## What Happened?

The 10 individual brief files (01-auth-and-context.md through 10-feedback-trust.md) have been **consolidated into a single living roadmap** at:

**`.context/roadmap.md`**

---

## Why?

Individual briefs became:
- Outdated quickly
- Never updated after completion
- Confusing (which is current?)
- Duplicative (repeated information)

The new system:
- One living roadmap for all features
- Update in place as work progresses
- Mark phases complete (don't delete)
- Single source of truth

---

## Where Are the Old Briefs?

Archived at: `.context/archive/briefs/`

These are kept for historical reference only—they are no longer current or maintained.

---

## What to Use Instead?

**For feature planning:**
- See `.context/roadmap.md` - All phases and features live here
- Update roadmap as you complete work
- Mark items complete (✅), don't delete them

**For implementation:**
- Create tickets in `dev/tickets/` when needed
- Write implementation logs in `dev/logs/` after significant work
- Both reference the roadmap for context

**See `.context/DOCUMENT-SYSTEM.md` for full documentation maintenance protocol.**
