## Instructions

For each section below, add:

2. **Your language** - how you naturally talk about compatibility
3. **Weight/importance** - how critical is this factor (1-10 scale)
4. **Context**: Does this apply to romantic only? Friendship? Both? Professional?

Be specific! Instead of "shared values", write "I need someone who values personal growth and isn't content staying stuck in patterns."

## Detection Patterns

How do you detect these attributes in conversation?

### Example: "They value personal growth"

**Language patterns:**
- "I'm in therapy and working on..."
- "I used to be X but I've grown to..."
- "That relationship taught me..."
- "I'm reading this book about..."

**Behavioral cues:**
- They ask reflective questions
- They admit mistakes and learn from them
- They talk about evolution, not being stuck

**How you'd describe it:**
"Someone who's doing the work, not just coasting"

## Open Questions

Before implementing Phase 3, we need to answer:

1. **How do we handle contradictions?**
   - Example: User says "I value independence" but also "I need constant connection"
   - How do we interpret this?

2. **How much does context affect interpretation?**
   - Does "I love hiking" mean the same thing in romantic vs friendship context?
   - Or does it mean "romantic dates outdoors" vs "friend group adventures"?

3. **What about evolution over time?**
   - User's compatibility factors may change (post-breakup, after therapy, life transitions)
   - How often do we re-analyze?

4. **How do we handle uncommon preferences?**
   - Most people might value "loyalty" but some might prioritize "adventure over stability"
   - Does our algorithm penalize outliers?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fill in this document** with your real examples and language
2. **Review after Phase 2 testing** with real users - do their patterns match yours?
3. **Refine weights** based on what actually predicts successful matches
4. **Design prompts** that detect these specific patterns in conversation
5. **Implement Phase 3** with validated compatibility framework
