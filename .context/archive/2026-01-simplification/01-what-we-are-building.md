# What We're Building

## The Product

Real-world dating through group events with mystery and intrigue. Users discover who's who through in-person conversation and in groups or events, not profiles. This allows the potential for meeting others without needing to swipe.

## How Matching Works

### The Hierarchy (Core)

Relationship duration follows three layers:

1. **Attraction** (short term, fling potential) - Physical chemistry
2. **Lifestyle** (medium term, dating) - Day-to-day compatibility (energy, schedule, social needs)
3. **Values** (long term, partner) - Big-picture alignment (kids, marriage, career, beliefs)

Each layer adds time. All three = lifetime potential.

### The Filters (Safety/Quality)

- **Decency** - How people treat others (tracked through event feedback, not self-reported)
- **Psychology** - Attachment style, readiness (helps filter who's actually ready)

These aren't part of hierarchy. They're safety checks.

## How Profiles Work

### Conversational Profiling

Users chat with system naturally. No forms. System interprets patterns through therapeutic frameworks (Gabor Maté, Esther Perel, Gottman).

Profile becomes: "Here's what we're hearing from you..."

### Progressive Profiling (Gating)

- Answer basic questions → see some people (pictures only)
- Answer lifestyle questions → can swipe on those people
- Answer depth questions → unlock people who require depth

Women can say: "I want matches who know their attachment style." Men who want to meet her see her picture but can't swipe until they answer those questions.

Gate access to more people behind more questions. Motivated users complete, unmotivated self-select out.

## How Events Work

### Group Matching, Not User-to-User

System creates events (or venues/users do). Users RSVP. System shows:
- Event details (where, when, what)
- Photos of who's attending (first name, age, city)
- 2-3 mysterious insights per user about OTHER attendees

**Example insights:**
- "Someone here shares your energy level"
- "One person has similar family goals"
- "Another person might feel unfamiliar but high potential"

Users don't know which insight = which person. They discover through conversation at the event.

### The Big Deal Moment

When attraction + lifestyle + values all match (rare), highlight that person's photo visually. "You match on paper AND in attraction."

### No In-App Chat

Limited to likes/winks/emojis. All real connection happens IRL.

### Post-Event Feedback

Users rate others:
- Behavioral: Respectful? Honest? Would meet again?
- Safety: Express concern if needed
- Romantic interest: Signal attraction

Builds decency scores. Low decency = limited access. High decency = prioritized.

## Why This Works

**Lifestyle is overlooked but critical.** You can't discover psychological depth if schedules/energy don't align. Most relationships fail on practical incompatibility.

**Decency is the foundation.** Without respect and safety, nothing else matters. Track through behavior, not self-reports.

**Progressive profiling filters naturally.** Motivated users go deeper, unmotivated drop off. Higher quality matches.

**Mystery creates intrigue.** Not knowing who's who until you meet = more authentic, less judgment.

**Real-world validation.** Chemistry happens in person. App gets out of the way.

---

## Build Order

1. **Attraction** - Photo swiping, basic events
2. **Lifestyle** - 10-15 questions (energy, social, spontaneity), scoring, mysterious insights
3. **Values** - 8-12 questions (kids, marriage, career), scoring, dealbreaker filtering
4. **Decency** - Post-event feedback, aggregate scores, flag/prioritize users
5. **Psychology** - Optional depth (attachment, communication), progressive profiling nudges
6. **Advanced** - Group dynamics, recommendation engine, paid features

---

## What Makes It Different

- **Profiles interpreted, not authored** - System reflects patterns back, users refine through chat
- **Lifestyle first** - Day-to-day compatibility determines if people can spend time together
- **Decency tracked** - Real behavior, not self-reports
- **Mystery** - Don't know who's who until you meet
- **Real-world first** - No chatting, just coordination
- **Progressive profiling** - Depth unlocks access, filters naturally

---

That's it. Build in that order. Keep it simple. Get people meeting IRL.
