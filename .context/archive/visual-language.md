Below is a **visual language & brand vibe brief** that matches the north star: human-first, nostalgic-but-modern, technology as background tool—not the point.

---

## Visual Language & Brand Vibe

**“Something old, made useful again.”**

### Core Feeling

* Calm
* Grounded
* Familiar
* Slightly nostalgic
* Gently modern

This should feel like remembering how dating *used to feel*—before feeds, metrics, and performance—without pretending technology doesn’t exist.

---

## Philosophical Anchor

Technology should behave like:

* a good host
* a quiet matchmaker
* a background facilitator

Not:

* a toy
* a game
* a mirror
* a slot machine

The best compliment the product can receive:

> “This doesn’t feel like an app.”

---

## Temporal Inspiration (Implied, Not Literal)

Evokes:

* pre-smartphone dating
* early internet optimism (not social media)
* handwritten notes → now typed quietly
* meeting through friends, classes, gatherings
* time moving a little slower

Avoid:

* retro kitsch
* fake film grain
* costume nostalgia

This is **memory, not cosplay**.

---

## Visual System

### Relationship Modes

* Should feel equally natural for romantic and friendship tracks—intent is explicit and kept separate
* No cross-mode nudging; friendship stays friendship unless both choose otherwise
* Friendship moments favor group/activity cues and low-pressure first meetings
* In friendship mode, avoid attraction scoring visuals; feedback centers on clarity, trust, and reliability

### Color Palette

* Warm neutrals
* Soft off-whites, sand, stone
* Muted blues, forest greens, clay
* No pure black or harsh white
* No high-saturation “tech colors”

Think:

* paper
* daylight
* café walls
* library tables
* evening lamps

---

### Typography

Primary traits:

* Humanist
* Slightly imperfect
* High readability
* Calm rhythm

Avoid:

* Ultra-geometric sans
* “Startup” fonts
* Anything that screams efficiency or speed

Text should feel:

* readable in long form
* comfortable
* patient

---

### Motion & Interaction

* Slow transitions
* Gentle fades
* No snapping
* No bounce
* No fireworks

Nothing should demand attention.
Everything should *invite* it.

---

### UI Density

* Plenty of white space
* Fewer elements per screen
* Content breathes
* One primary action at a time

This should feel like:

* opening a book
* sitting down
* not being rushed

---

## Photography & Imagery

If used at all:

* Natural light
* Imperfect moments
* People not posing for the camera
* Slight distance (not hyper-intimate)
* Groups, movement, context (especially for friendship moments)

Avoid:

* Influencer aesthetics
* Studio lighting
* Heavy filters
* Overly sexualized framing

Attraction is important—but it should feel **human, not optimized**.

---

## Tone of Voice (Critical)

* Conversational
* Thoughtful
* Lightly self-aware
* Never preachy
* Never instructional

We don’t say:

> “This is better for you.”

We imply:

> “This might feel better.”

---

## Brand Metaphor (Internal Only)

If most apps feel like:

* casinos
* marketplaces
* social feeds

This should feel like:

* being introduced by a friend
* showing up somewhere in person
* a conversation that doesn’t rush you

---

## One-Line Brand Essence

**Modern tools. Old instincts. Real people.**

---

## North Star Visual Rule (For Builders)

If a design choice:

* increases urgency → reject it
* increases comparison → reject it
* increases performativity → reject it

If it:

* slows the user down
* reduces decision fatigue
* nudges toward real life

It’s probably right.
