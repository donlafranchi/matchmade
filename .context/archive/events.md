Events are the **unifying surface** that make every relationship context real, low-pressure, and honest—without pretending we can predict chemistry.

---

## Why events unify all relationship contexts

**Events solve the same core problem everywhere:**
“How do two (or more) people move from alignment → real interaction without awkwardness?”

They work because they:

* Remove 1-on-1 pressure (vibe can emerge naturally)
* Allow multiple outcomes (friend, collaborator, nothing—and that’s fine)
* Reveal real behavior (energy, curiosity, follow-through)
* Scale across intents without changing the system

Romantic, friendship, creative, professional, service—all benefit.

## Event types mapped to relationship contexts

### Romantic

* Low-stakes group settings
* Values + interests already aligned
* Chemistry discovered organically

Examples:

* Trivia night
* Group hike
* Wine tasting
* Language exchange

---

### Friendship

* Shared interests first
* Zero attraction expectations
* Easy repeat attendance

Examples:

* Anime watch nights
* Pick-up sports
* Board game cafés
* Local walking groups

---

### Creative

* Output-oriented, not social theater
* Talent and work ethic visible immediately

Examples:

* Maker spaces
* Writing circles
* Music jam sessions
* Art critiques

---

### Professional / Business

* Trust built through behavior, not pitch decks
* Values and reliability matter more than charisma

Examples:

* Founder breakfasts
* Co-working sprints
* Skill-swap nights
* Project demo evenings

---

### Service (realtors, etc.)

* Reputation emerges through presence
* Less salesy, more human

Examples:

* “Ask a local expert” nights
* Neighborhood info sessions
* First-time buyer workshops

## What the app actually does with events

The app is **not just a matcher**.
It is a **relationship facilitator**.

### The system:

* Suggests relevant events based on values + interests
* Curates attendance to reduce mismatch
* Limits group size to preserve quality
* Prevents “everyone goes to everything”

You don’t browse events endlessly.
You’re **invited** to ones that fit.

## How events stay aligned with the north star

Key rules:

1. **Events are opt-in, not feeds**

   * No “what’s happening tonight?” scrolling
   * Fewer events, better fit

2. **Events are contextual**

   * You know why you’re there
   * Others share overlapping intent

3. **Events are outcome-agnostic**

   * No pressure to pair off
   * Success ≠ matching
   * Success = showing up

4. **Events reduce app dependency**

   * The app steps back once you arrive
   * Real life takes over

---

## Why this beats in-app messaging

* Vibe is discovered, not simulated
* Attraction is contextual, not isolated
* Conversation is anchored in reality
* Ghosting decreases naturally
* Misrepresentation is harder

---

## How this fits the values schema cleanly

Events use the same schema, just differently weighted:

* Values → who gets invited
* Interests → what kind of event
* Interaction style → group size / format
* Reliability → repeat invites
* Context → romantic vs friend vs creative

No new system required.
