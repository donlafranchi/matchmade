## What You’re Building (Conceptual Summary)

You are building a **relationship builder**, not a dating app.

The system exists to reduce exhaustion, noise, and false choice by doing the matchmaking *for* people, honestly, and helping them move into real-world relationships sooner.

This applies to **all relationship types**:

* romantic
* friendship
* professional
* creative
* service-based (e.g. realtor)

The same human principles apply across all of them.

## Core Experience (What the User Actually Does)

A new user does **not** write a profile or swipe.

Instead, they talk privately with a **personal matchmaker**—a software-based guide designed to listen, interpret, and represent them accurately through therapeutic understanding.

This is **not** chatting with other users.
This is **not** a traditional human matchmaker.
This is a personal system that:

* listens to how the user communicates naturally
* interprets patterns using therapeutic frameworks (Gabor Mate, Esther Perel, Gottman, IFS, Attachment Theory)
* reflects back "Here's what we're hearing from you"
* adapts tone and depth based on user preference
* builds an interpreted profile that reveals compatible patterns

The user can speak naturally and be specific.
The system interprets language to understand underlying patterns, attachment styles, values, and communication preferences—creating profiles that make users feel deeply understood rather than reduced to checkboxes.

## How Profiles Are Built (Key Insight)

Profiles are **interpreted, not authored**.

The system listens to natural conversation and interprets patterns across **five primary layers**, creating a reflective understanding rather than a data form:

---

### 1. Intent & Relationship Context (first-class)

* What kind of relationship is being built:

  * romantic, friendship, professional, creative, service
* Time horizon:

  * days / weeks / months / years
* Prevents mismatched expectations from the start

---

### 2. Values & Identity

* Core values emerge through therapeutic interpretation of language patterns
* What matters most reveals itself in how people talk about their lives
* The system reflects back: "You seem to prioritize authenticity and growth based on how you talk about relationships"
* Beliefs captured through importance × distance rather than public ideological labels
* Used to prevent deep misalignment while avoiding rigid categorization

---

### 3. Lifestyle & Living Patterns

* How someone actually lives day to day: rhythm, activity level, schedule, life stage
* Interpreted from conversational sharing rather than demographic checkboxes
* "You're based in San Francisco, navigating the tension between career ambition and creative pursuits"
* Replaces crude proxies like age ranges with actual life pattern compatibility
* Explains why some people "don't fit" even if values align

---

### 4. Connection Style & Attachment

* How it feels to relate to them: attachment patterns, communication style, pacing preferences, conflict approach
* Uses therapeutic frameworks:
  * **Gabor Mate lens:** Attachment styles, underlying needs, authentic vs adapted self
  * **Esther Perel lens:** Desire dynamics, paradoxes (security vs passion), cultural scripts
  * **Gottman lens:** Communication patterns, conflict resolution, emotional bids
  * **IFS lens:** Different parts of self, protective vs vulnerable parts
* Interprets underlying patterns without pathologizing: "You express a desire to take things slow, which might indicate valuing emotional safety before physical intimacy"
* Helps avoid obvious friction without claiming to predict chemistry

---

### 5. Tastes & Preferences

* What they're drawn to and what they avoid: food, music, activities, routines, rituals
* Interpreted from natural sharing rather than forced categorization
* The system notices strong positives, strong negatives, and personality signals in how preferences are expressed
* Framed personally ("These are a few of my favorite things") not as filters

---

### Optional Buckets (Used Only If Needed)

#### 6. Constraints

* Practical realities:

  * kids
  * location radius
  * schedule
  * monogamy model
* Context-dependent and never performative

#### 7. Trust / Feedback (private only)

* Post-meet feedback
* Internal reputation signals
* No public scores
* No shaming
* Used quietly to protect others and improve matching quality

---

## Attraction & Chemistry (Critical Clarifications)

* Attraction matters, but it is **not the starting point**
* Photos are shown **after alignment** through interpreted understanding
* Attraction is private, binary, and limited
* Chemistry is **discovered in person**
* The system creates conditions for chemistry to emerge through compatible pattern matching
* Matching happens on complementary attachment styles, aligned values, compatible communication—not checkbox overlap
* The system never claims to predict spark

This keeps expectations realistic and trust high.

---

## Events as the Bridge to Real Life

Events unify all relationship contexts:

* group settings reduce pressure
* behavior reveals compatibility
* vibe emerges naturally
* outcomes can be romantic, friendly, professional, or nothing—and that’s okay

Events are:

* suggested, not browsed endlessly
* curated based on interests and context
* often the default way matches meet

---

## Trust & Safety Philosophy

* Users can share sensitive truths
* “Off-the-record” means raw content is not stored
* Users can ask the system to forget
* Only abstracted signals remain (if the user allows)
* A breach would not expose intimate details

Trust is built through **reversibility and restraint**, not promises.

## What Makes This Different (At the Core)

* No bios or rigid forms
* No swiping feeds
* No illusion of infinite choice
* No forced performance or checkbox categorization
* No endless chat

Instead:

* Conversational profiling with therapeutic interpretation
* "Here's what we're hearing from you" reflective understanding
* Pattern-based matching (compatible attachment, aligned values, complementary communication)
* Users feel deeply understood, not reduced to data points
* Fewer, better matches
* Clearer expectations
* Faster movement into real life
* Healthier relationships over time

## What to Archive

You now only need to keep:

* **North Star Brief (1 page)**
* **Codex Build Prompt**
* **Landing Page Copy**
* *(Optional)* PRODUCT_RULES.md

This conversation can be archived safely.
All meaningful decisions are now encoded in those artifacts.
