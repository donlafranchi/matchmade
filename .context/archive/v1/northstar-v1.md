# Relationship Builder — North Star

This product exists to help people build real, healthy relationships—romantic or otherwise—without the tedious swipes, awkward first dates with mismatched people, and endless texting that goes nowhere.

Most people aren't short on matches.
They're overwhelmed by volume, underwhelmed by fit, and tired of the work required by today's dating apps.

This system does the matchmaking for the user—so they can meet people they actually click with.

Users don't write bios or perform. They talk with a personal matchmaker—software that listens, interprets, and represents them accurately through therapeutic understanding. Not chatting with matches. Not a human matchmaker. A personal system that learns who they are, how they live, and what actually matters by interpreting their language through psychological frameworks.

Profiles are interpreted, not authored.

The system uses therapeutic frameworks (Gabor Mate, Esther Perel, Gottman, IFS, Attachment Theory) to understand patterns in how users communicate. The profile becomes "Here's what we're hearing from you"—a reflective mirror showing interpreted insights rather than checkbox data. This creates deeper understanding and better matches based on compatible patterns, not surface-level overlap.

Understanding is built across five primary human layers through conversational interpretation:

1. **Intent & Relationship Context**
   Clear about what kind of relationship they're building (romantic, friendship, professional, creative, service) and their timeline. Interpreted from natural language about what they're seeking. Prevents mismatched expectations from the start.

2. **Values & Identity**
   Core values emerge through therapeutic interpretation of language patterns. What matters most reveals itself in how people talk about their lives, not through forced rankings. The system reflects back: "You seem to prioritize authenticity and growth based on how you talk about relationships."

3. **Lifestyle & Living Patterns**
   How someone actually lives day to day—rhythm, activity level, schedule, life stage. Interpreted from conversational sharing rather than demographic checkboxes. Real compatibility emerges from understanding actual life patterns.

4. **Connection Style & Attachment**
   How it feels to relate to them: attachment patterns, communication style, pacing preferences, conflict approach. Uses frameworks from Gabor Mate (attachment, needs), Esther Perel (desire, paradox), and Gottman (communication patterns) to interpret underlying patterns without pathologizing.

5. **Tastes & Preferences**
   What they're drawn to and what they avoid. Food, music, activities, routines. Interpreted from natural sharing rather than forced categorization.

Optional layers when relevant:
* **Constraints** (kids, location, schedule, relationship structure)
* **Trust & Feedback** (private, internal signals only)

The profile interface shows therapeutic interpretations: "Here's what we're hearing from you about how you approach relationships..." Users can refine interpretations through conversation: "That's not quite right—let me clarify." The system learns and updates, creating profiles that make users feel deeply understood rather than reduced to data points.

Matching happens based on compatible psychological patterns, not checkbox overlap. The system looks for complementary attachment styles, aligned values, and compatible communication patterns—conditions where chemistry can emerge.

Attraction is respected but handled privately—no feeds. Photos shown only after baseline alignment. Chemistry is never promised—only conditions for it to emerge in real life.

The system is real about opportunities. No padding. If there are no strong matches, it says so and offers one small, meaningful next step.

Events are the primary bridge to real life. Group settings reduce pressure, reveal real behavior, and let relationships form naturally.

Trust is foundational. Users can share sensitive truths and ask for them to be forgotten. Raw "off-the-record" disclosures aren't stored—only abstracted compatibility signals if allowed. Therapeutic interpretations are shown transparently to users, never hidden or used only algorithmically.

Success is measured by:
* Users feeling deeply understood ("This really gets me")
* Fewer but better matches based on compatible patterns
* Less tedious work for users (no endless forms)
* Faster movement to real-world meetings
* Healthier, longer-lasting relationships
* Users needing the app less over time

This is not a dating app.
It's a relationship builder that listens, interprets, and gets out of your way—moving you toward real life where chemistry actually happens.

## Implementation Philosophy

The current rigid forms (dropdowns for relationship timeline, exclusivity, etc.) are temporary scaffolding. They allow the system to function while the therapeutic interpretation engine is built.

The real product vision:
- Conversational data collection (natural language sharing)
- LLM-powered interpretation through therapeutic frameworks
- Profile as "Here's what we're hearing from you"
- Fuzzy boundaries and spectrums instead of rigid categories
- Chat-based refinement when interpretations miss the mark
- Matching on compatible patterns, not checkbox overlap

See /dev/vision/profile-as-interpretation.md for detailed implementation architecture.
