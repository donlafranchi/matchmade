# Matchmade Vision

Technology that reduces swiping and performing. The system sorts and matches;
people discover chemistry in person.

## The Problem We Solve

Dating apps make people perform. They swipe endlessly. They never meet.
We flip this: technology does the sorting, humans do the meeting.

## Three Pillars

| Pillar | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Attraction** | Gets people interested | Starting chemistry |
| **Lifestyle** | Day-to-day compatibility | Can they spend time together? |
| **Values** | Long-term alignment | What keeps people together |

Attraction gets you in the door. Lifestyle determines if you can date. Values determine if you last.

## How It Works

1. **Profiles are interpreted, not authored** - Users chat, system reflects patterns back
2. **Matching is anonymous** - See faces + mysterious insights, not profiles
3. **Events, not endless chat** - Meet in groups, discover who's who in person
4. **Decency is tracked** - Real behavior from events, not self-reports

## What Technology Does

- Interprets what you share using therapeutic frameworks
- Sorts people by compatibility (attraction x lifestyle x values)
- Shows mysterious hints ("Someone here shares your energy")
- Tracks who's trustworthy through real-world feedback

## What Humans Do

- Chat naturally (no forms)
- Show up to events
- Discover chemistry face-to-face
- Keep each other honest through feedback
