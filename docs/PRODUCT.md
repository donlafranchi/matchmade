## What We're Building

A dating app where technology does the sorting and humans do the meeting.

## Why

### Problem
Dating apps make people perform. They swipe endlessly. They craft bios. They message for weeks. They never meet.

### Who Has This Problem
People tired of the swiping treadmill who want genuine connections without the performative aspects of modern dating apps.

### Current Alternatives
- Swiping apps (Tinder, Hinge, Bumble) - endless swiping, bio crafting, text conversations that go nowhere
- Matchmaking services - expensive, limited options
- Speed dating events - awkward, no pre-filtering

## Core Value Proposition

Profiles are interpreted, not authored. Matching is anonymous. Events replace endless chat. Meet in person, discover chemistry face-to-face.

## Three Pillars

| Pillar | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Attraction** | Gets people interested | Starting chemistry |
| **Lifestyle** | Day-to-day compatibility | Can they spend time together? |
| **Values** | Long-term alignment | What keeps people together |

## How It Works

1. **Profiles are interpreted, not authored** - Users chat, system reflects patterns back
2. **Matching is anonymous** - See faces + mysterious insights, not profiles
3. **Events, not endless chat** - Meet in groups, discover who's who in person
4. **Decency is tracked** - Real behavior from events, not self-reports

## Success Looks Like

- Users spend less time in-app, more time meeting people
- High event attendance rates
- Relationships that start from in-person chemistry

## Out of Scope

- Gamification and engagement optimization
- Endless messaging features
- Swiping mechanics
- Profile crafting tools
