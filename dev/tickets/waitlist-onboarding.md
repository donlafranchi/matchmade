# Feature: Onboarding + Regional Waitlist

## Status: Ready to Build

## Problem
Need to collect users before matching is possible. Must communicate philosophy and differentiation. Must build regional critical mass before opening markets.

## Solution

### Philosophy-First Introduction
- Brief manifesto moment on splash: "You deserve better than endless swiping"
- Communicate core differentiators: curated matches, meet in person, matchmaker works for you

### Agent-as-Onboarding
- First interaction is conversation with matchmaker agent, not form-filling
- Agent collects profile information through natural dialogue
- Agent explains how the app works through the conversation

### Email Collection
- Frame as service: "Where should we reach you when we find someone worth meeting?"
- Required for waitlist and notifications

### Regional Waitlist
- Collect location during onboarding
- Don't open matching in a region until minimum user threshold met
- Show waitlist position: "You're #347 in [City]. We'll notify you when we're ready."
- Build anticipation, not frustration

### Scope for V1
- Deprioritize "beyond romance" positioning
- Focus on romantic matching to prove model
- Can expand use cases later

## Dependencies
- Agent chat system
- User database with location
- Waitlist management system
- Email notification system

## Success Metrics
- Email collection rate
- Waitlist conversion when region opens
- Drop-off points in onboarding flow
