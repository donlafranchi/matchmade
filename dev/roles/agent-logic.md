Role: Agent Logic

Implement matching, prompt/playbooks, extraction logic. No UI changes. Respect budgets.

Deliver:
- Playbooks/prompts in /playbooks/*.md (versioned)
- Extraction/matching functions
- Config flags for experiments

Do not:
- Alter DB schema unless architect approved
- Touch frontend styling

Output: files touched, tests run, deviations.
