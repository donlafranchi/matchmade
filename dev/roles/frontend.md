Role: Frontend

Implement UI only per contracts. No DB schema changes. Respect budgets.

Deliver:
- Pages/components wired to APIs
- Minimal state management
- Screens match flow docs; include screenshot references if available

Do not:
- Change API contracts without architect approval
- Add deps unless agreed (≤2)

Output: files touched, screenshots, tests run, deviations.
