# About Page / Philosophy

## Goal
Public manifesto communicating why this app is different, without being preachy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] About page accessible from app and website
- [ ] Core tenets clearly stated
- [ ] Philosophy reflected in agent voice (demonstrated, not just stated)

## Core Tenets (Draft)
1. We measure success by exits, not engagement
2. Scarcity is a feature — fewer, better options
3. Meet soon or move on — real connection happens in person
4. Your matchmaker works for you, not advertisers
5. Growth over comfort — we'll push you toward vulnerability
6. Grace over judgment — people are imperfect

## Constraints
- No dedicated "philosophy discussion" feature
- Philosophy demonstrated through product, not discussed as feature
- Brief touch during onboarding, not lecture

## Plan
1. Create about page with manifesto
2. Update agent voice guidelines
3. Add philosophy moment to onboarding

## Dependencies
- Website/app about page
- Agent personality/voice guidelines
