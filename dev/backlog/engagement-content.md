# Engagement/Content Layer

**Status:** Still in Design — core mechanics undefined, risk of becoming engagement trap

## Goal
Periodic cultural moment prompts that generate matching signals and ice-breaker material without becoming a social feed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Periodic prompts tied to viral/cultural content
- [ ] User reactions feed matching algorithm
- [ ] Reactions generate ice-breaker material
- [ ] Ephemeral, low-stakes (no permanent profile of "takes")
- [ ] Not required — users can ignore entirely

## Constraints (Non-Negotiable)
- Engagement serves matching, not content for its own sake
- No social feed, no personal brand building
- No likes from other users, no leaderboard
- No performance anxiety

## Open Questions (Blocking)
- Who creates prompts? Editorial team? Automated?
- How often? Daily? Weekly?
- Do users see others' responses? (risky) Or only agents see? (safer)
- How to measure matching impact vs just engagement?

## Plan
1. Start with simple weekly prompt
2. Responses visible only to agents
3. Measure impact on match quality before expanding

## Dependencies
- Agent system that incorporates engagement data
- Content management for prompts
- Analytics to measure matching impact
