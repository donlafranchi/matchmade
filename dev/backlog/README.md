# Backlog

Unprioritized queue of features to build. Not a commitment — a parking lot.

## How to Use
1. When ready to work, pull an item into `tickets/` and assign a ticket number
2. Break large items into smaller tickets as needed
3. Completed tickets tracked in `docs/STATUS.md`

## Current Items

### Core Flow (Build Order)
These enable the primary user journey:

1. **photo-upload.md** — Photos for two-stage filter (character → attraction)
2. **interaction-flow.md** — Nudge → Wink → Crush Note → Accept (no DMs)
3. **events.md** — Group events as primary meeting mode
4. **ice-breakers.md** — Agent-generated conversation starters
5. **reputation-system.md** — No-show tracking, timeouts, trust scores

### Infrastructure
- **deployment.md** — Deploy to Vercel for beta users
- **regional-waitlist.md** — Don't open regions until critical mass

### Enhancements
