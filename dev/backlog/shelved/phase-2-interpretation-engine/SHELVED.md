# Shelved: Interpretation Engine

**Shelved:** 2026-01-20
**Reason:** Pivoting to waitlist-first onboarding before building deep interpretation features

## What This Was
Therapeutic interpretation engine using Gabor Maté framework to analyze user conversations and reflect back insights ("Here's what we're hearing from you").

## Why Shelved
- Need to collect users before we can test matching
- Waitlist onboarding is higher priority for pre-launch
- Interpretation engine requires active users having conversations
- Can revisit after beta launch with real user data

## What Was Completed
- Schema design (tickets 2-01 through 2-05)
- Architecture documented
- Some implementation work (see logs/archive/)

## To Resume
Read the README.md in this folder - it has complete implementation details.
