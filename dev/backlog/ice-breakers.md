# Ice-Breakers

## Goal
Agent-generated conversation starters based on shared interests, reactions, and lifestyle overlaps to make first meetings less awkward.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Agent surfaces shared specific interests before meetings
- [ ] Ice-breakers prioritize esoteric over generic ("both think X comedian is underrated" > "both like music")
- [ ] User can ask "Why do you think we'd be compatible?"
- [ ] Pre-event ice-breakers for compatible attendees

## Constraints
- Not a test or evaluation
- Agent delivers to each user separately (not visible to both simultaneously)
- Interaction not required before meeting

## Plan
1. Extract shared interests from lifestyle data
2. Build ice-breaker generation logic
3. Add "why compatible" agent response
4. Integrate with event pre-attendance flow

## Dependencies
- Lifestyle data collection (unstructured agent conversation)
- Compatibility assessment system
- Introduction flow
