# Events System

## Goal
Facilitate in-person meetings through curated group events at partner venues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Event listing with RSVP functionality
- [ ] Agent suggests events based on user preferences and compatible attendees
- [ ] Pre-event: show photos of compatible attendees (with compatibility indicators)
- [ ] Post-event: agent follows up, collects feedback
- [ ] Venue partnership management

## Constraints
- Not a swiping app (attraction check is contextualized, not gamified)
- Events are primary mechanism for meeting, not required
- Group setting reduces pressure vs one-on-one dates

## Plan
1. Event and Venue schema
2. RSVP API and UI
3. Compatible attendee photo display
4. Post-event feedback flow
5. Venue partnership admin

## Dependencies
- Photo upload system
- Compatibility scoring
