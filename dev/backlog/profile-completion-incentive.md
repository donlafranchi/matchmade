# Profile Completion Incentive

## Goal
Motivate users to complete their profile by showing what's unlocked, framed as anticipation not punishment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Progress indicator showing completion percentage
- [ ] Blurred previews of what's gated (photos, matches)
- [ ] Satisfying reveal when profile hits threshold
- [ ] Messaging feels motivating, not frustrating

## Constraints
- Frame as "unlock" not "you can't see this"
- Clear progress toward goal
- Don't require 100% — threshold is enough

## Plan
1. Define completion threshold and criteria
2. Add progress indicator to profile view
3. Gate match photos until threshold
4. Add unlock animation/reveal

## Dependencies
- Profile data to calculate completion
- Photo system (for gating)
- Match display (for gating)
