# Premium Tiers

**Status:** Still in Design — pricing model needs validation

## Goal
Revenue through premium features without compromising scarcity philosophy (cannot sell "more matches").

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Long-distance search as core premium feature
- [ ] Free tier with full local matching
- [ ] Premium tier with expanded geography
- [ ] Payment infrastructure

## Confirmed Premium Feature: Long-Distance Search
- User requests expanded search to agent
- Agent searches wider geography with same quality standards
- More extensive agent-to-agent vetting for long-distance matches
- Facilitate contact exchange or travel coordination if both interested

## Open Questions (Blocking)
- Pricing model: subscription vs one-time unlock vs usage-based?
- Additional premium benefits? (faster responses, concierge planning, event priority)
- Location verification to prevent gaming?

## Plan
1. Launch simple: free local + single paid tier for expanded search
2. Learn what users value before complex tier structure
3. Explore event revenue as primary, premium as secondary

## Dependencies
- Core matching system
- Agent chat with usage tracking
- Payment infrastructure
- Event system (if events are revenue)
