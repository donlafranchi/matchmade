# dev/logs/ Directory

**Purpose:** Temporary implementation notes. Most documentation lives elsewhere.

## Primary Documentation

| Current project state | `dev/project-state.md` |
| Historical changes | `git log` / `git blame` |

## When to Create Logs

Only create logs here for:
- **Troubleshooting sessions** that might help debug future issues
- **Complex migrations** with multi-step procedures
- **Temporary working notes** (delete when done)

Most work doesn't need a log. Decisions go in `decisions.md`, code explains itself with comments.

## Archive

Historical logs from earlier phases: `archive/`
