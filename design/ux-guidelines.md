# UX & Tone Guidelines

**Status:** Core product principles

---

## Voice

Conversational, thoughtful, lightly self-aware. Never preachy. Easy flow - no hype, no countdowns, no urgency badges.

---

## Non-Negotiables

1. **One primary action per screen** (no feeds)
2. **Values/intent alignment before attraction UI**
3. **Attraction is private, fast, photos-only** (no text during attraction step)
4. **Real about availability** - no fake matches or padding
5. **Coordination-only messaging** - not pen-pal texting
6. **Sensitive disclosures:** "off the record" + "forget that" support (do NOT store raw text)
7. **Interface stays uncluttered:** warm neutrals, soft type, plenty of space

## Copy Patterns to Reuse

### Easy, Natural Flow
- "Skip the tedious work"
- "Meet people you actually click with"
- "Gets out of your way"

### Real About Chemistry
- "We don't promise chemistry. We promise honesty."
- "Chemistry happens in person, not on screens."
- "We create the conditions. You discover the spark."
- "Not every good match becomes a spark. But sparks need the right conditions to exist."
- "Attraction matters. But it isn't static. And it isn't everything."

### Avoiding Wrong-Fit Dates
- "No awkward first dates with wrong-fit people"
- "Skip the pen-pal texting that goes nowhere"
- "Fewer dates, better matches"

### No Matches State
- "No matches yet" when there aren't any (no padding)
- "We're still looking" without urgency or consolation
- No overpromising language ("aligned", "worth exploring", "potential match")

---

## Visual Vibe

- Warm neutrals
- Soft typography
- Plenty of whitespace
- No grids of faces
- No busy feeds
- One clear action per screen

---

## First-Run Flow

### 1. Arrival
Warm, human moment. Not corporate, not startup-y.

### 2. Reframing
Values-first prompt. Set expectations early.

### 3. Promise
One simple card with single CTA: "Get started"
Include mode choice line (romantic, friendship, both)

---

## Intent Separation

- **Onboarding requires explicit intent:** romantic, friendship, or both
- **Tracks are kept separate** - no leakage between them
- **No "friends → dating" nudging** without consent
- **No attraction scoring/visuals in friendship mode**
- **Friendship feedback centers on:** clarity, trust, reliability (not attraction)

---

## Messaging Philosophy

### Skip the Pen-Pal Phase
- Coordination-focused messaging with message caps
- Default CTA is meeting IRL
- Group/activity cues for friendship context
- Chemistry develops in person, not through endless texting

---

## Things to Avoid

- Engagement optimization
- Dopamine loops
- Infinite scrolling
- Urgency badges ("5 people viewed you!")
- Gamification mechanics
- Fake scarcity
- Notification spam
- Match inflation

---

## Guardrails

- Honor user requests to forget sensitive inputs
- Surface real availability, not padding
- Goal: less tedious work, more real meetings
- Sensitive content: support "off the record" and "forget that"
- Do NOT store raw text of sensitive disclosures
- Zero out derived fields when forgetting

---

*These guidelines apply to all contexts (romantic, friendship, etc.) unless noted.*
