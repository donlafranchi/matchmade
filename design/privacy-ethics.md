# Privacy & Ethics

**Status:** Core principles (non-negotiable)

---

## Transparency

- Always show users what we're learning about them
- Never hide analysis or use it only algorithmically
- Users should understand what patterns we're seeing
- Clear language about confidence levels ("we think" not "you are")

---

## User Control

- Users can reject any insight about themselves
- Users can pause profiling entirely
- Users can delete all data and start fresh
- No psychological profiling without explicit consent
- Opt-in for deeper analysis (attachment styles, etc.)

---

## Reflective, Not Diagnostic

- **We are not diagnosing** - never "you have anxious attachment disorder"
- **We are reflecting patterns** - "we notice you tend to..."
- Use non-judgmental, growth-oriented language
- Avoid pathologizing normal relationship patterns
- Frame everything as self-discovery, not clinical assessment

---

## Data Sensitivity

### What We Store
- Derived insights (not raw sensitive disclosures)
- Aggregated patterns (not individual statements)
- Confidence levels for all inferences

### What We Never Store
- Raw text of sensitive disclosures
- Anything marked "off the record"
- Content after user says "forget that"

### Data Boundaries
- Interpretations are highly personal - secure storage required
- Never share raw insights with matches directly
- Only use derived compatibility scores (invisible details)
- Clear data deletion policy - actually delete, don't just hide

---

## Sensitive Disclosures

### "Off the Record" Support
- User can mark messages as off-the-record before sending
- These messages are processed but NOT stored
- System can respond/learn but raw text is discarded

### "Forget That" Support
- User can request deletion of recent messages
- Removes stored content
- Zeros out any derived fields from that content
- Acknowledges the request without judgment

---

## Gentle Intervention Principles

We are NOT therapists. We only intervene briefly in serious situations:

### When to Nudge
- User appears to be in crisis (self-harm language, severe distress)
- User is about to do something impulsive they may regret
- Pattern suggests user isn't in a good headspace for dating

### How to Nudge
- Brief, gentle, non-preachy
- Offer resources, don't prescribe solutions
- One nudge, then back off - not persistent
- "Hey, want to take a break?" not "You need help"

### What We Don't Do
- Ongoing therapy or counseling
- Diagnose mental health conditions
- Push users toward professional help repeatedly
- Act as a substitute for real mental health support

---

## Matching Ethics

### What We Show Matches
- Compatibility indicators (vague, not specific)
- Mysterious insights ("you both value...")
- Never: raw psychological profiles, attachment labels, or sensitive details

### Consent for Sharing
- Users control what's visible to matches
- Default: minimal (just compatibility score)
- Opt-in: share more specific insights

### Avoiding Harm
- Don't match people in ways that could be harmful
- Flag concerning patterns (but don't over-police)
- Decency tracking based on real behavior, not assumptions

---

## Cultural Considerations

- Therapeutic frameworks are Western-centric
- Attachment theory has cultural biases
- Offer frameworks as one lens, not universal truth
- Allow users to opt out of psychological profiling entirely

---

## Open Questions

1. How do we handle users who reject all insights? Still match them?
2. What's the threshold for a "gentle nudge" intervention?
3. How long do we retain data before auto-deletion?
4. Should users be able to see what compatibility factors led to a match?

---

*These principles are non-negotiable. Features that violate them should not ship.*
