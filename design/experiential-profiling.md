# Experiential Profiling

**Status:** Core design approach

---

## Philosophy

We don't ask people to describe themselves. We ask about their experiences.

Everyone says they value trust, honesty, and communication. But these words mean different things to different people. By asking "What does trust look like to you?" instead of "Do you value trust?" we reveal what actually matters.

**Key principles:**
- Small set of high-quality questions, not exhaustive surveys
- Let users describe things in their own words
- Always offer: "Is there another way you think about this?"
- How someone answers is itself a matching signal
- **Meet people where they are** — not everyone has relationship experience
- **Help people learn about themselves**, not just report what they already know

---

## Designing for Inexperience

Our questions assume self-awareness and relationship experience that many users don't have. A 19-year-old who's never been in a serious relationship can't meaningfully answer "What does trust look like to you?" — they're guessing or parroting.

### What inexperienced users DON'T know

| We Ask | What It Assumes |
|--------|-----------------|
| "What does trust look like?" | You've experienced trust being built or broken |
| "How do you handle conflict?" | You've been in relationship conflicts |
| "What do you need when things get hard?" | You know yourself under stress with a partner |
| "What does healthy space look like?" | You've navigated independence in a relationship |

### What inexperienced users DO know

- What they like doing (concrete activities, hobbies)
- What annoys them (immediate reactions)
- Who they admire (models of who they want to be)
- What feels fun vs. draining
- Basic social preferences
- What they think they want (even if it'll evolve)

### Experience Levels

Users fall roughly into three categories:

| Level | Characteristics | Question Approach |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **New** | Few/no relationships, limited self-knowledge, may be anxious | Concrete scenarios, simple choices, normalize uncertainty |
| **Learning** | Some experience, starting to notice patterns, forming preferences | Mix of concrete and reflective, validate their emerging insights |
| **Experienced** | Multiple relationships, clearer self-knowledge, knows what works/doesn't | Deeper questions, nuance welcome, can articulate needs |

**How to detect:** Ask directly during onboarding: "How much dating experience do you have?" with options like:
- "I'm pretty new to this"
- "I've dated some but still figuring things out"
- "I have a good sense of what I'm looking for"

This isn't about judging — it's about asking the right questions.

---

## Scenario-Based Questions (For Less Experienced Users)

Instead of abstract questions requiring self-knowledge, present concrete scenarios that reveal the same dimensions.

### Scenario Format

```
[Situation] → [How do you feel / What do you do?]
```

### Examples by Dimension

**Trust** (instead of "What does trust look like?")
- "Your partner is texting someone and smiling. What's your first thought?"
- "You find out your partner told a small lie to avoid hurting your feelings. How do you feel?"

**Conflict** (instead of "How do you handle disagreements?")
- "You're upset about something your partner did. Do you bring it up right away, wait until you've calmed down, or hope it resolves itself?"
- "In an argument, your partner says they need space. What goes through your head?"

**Independence** (instead of "What does healthy space look like?")
- "Your partner wants to spend Saturday with their friends instead of you. How do you feel?"
- "You have a free evening. Your partner wants to hang out but you'd rather be alone. What do you do?"

**Spontaneity** (instead of "How do you feel when plans change?")
- "You had dinner plans but your partner suggests a spontaneous road trip instead. What's your reaction?"
- "Your partner surprises you by showing up at your work. Is this sweet or uncomfortable?"

**Support** (instead of "What do you need when things get hard?")
- "You've had a terrible day. Your partner offers to talk about it. Do you want to vent, be distracted, or be alone?"
- "You're stressed about something. Your partner tries to fix the problem. Is this helpful or frustrating?"

### Why Scenarios Work Better

1. **No experience required** — They imagine, not remember
2. **Reveals intuitive response** — Less time to construct "good" answer
3. **Concrete = honest** — Abstract questions invite idealized answers
4. **Shows how they think** — Process of answering is data

---

## Graduated Depth

Questions should deepen as users gain experience — both with dating generally and with our app specifically.

### Onboarding (Everyone)

Simple, concrete, low-pressure:

1. "What do you like doing for fun?" (lifestyle basics)
2. "What are you looking for?" (intent - direct choice)
3. "After a long day, do you want company or alone time?" (social/energy)
4. "Plans change last minute — are you relieved or annoyed?" (spontaneity)
5. "How much dating experience do you have?" (calibrates future questions)

### Week 1-2 (Scenario Questions)

Based on their experience level, introduce scenarios:
- New users: More scenarios, simpler choices
- Experienced users: Can skip to reflective questions

### After First Match

Now they have context to reflect:
- "What are you hoping happens with this match?"
- "Anything you're nervous about?"

### After First Date

Real experience to learn from:
- Feedback on the date (T006)
- "What surprised you about meeting them?"
- "Anything you noticed about yourself?"

### After Multiple Dates

Patterns emerge, can ask deeper:
- "What's working in dates that go well?"
- "What's a pattern you've noticed in what attracts you?"
- Now the abstract questions make sense: "What does trust mean to you now?"

## Helping Young Men

There's a crisis among young men: social isolation, toxic "advice" sources, fear of rejection, inability to read social cues. The app can help — not by lowering standards, but by building skills.

### The Problems

| Issue | How It Shows Up |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Social isolation** | Limited practice with real interaction |
| **Toxic advice** | Red pill, pickup artists, transactional views of dating |
| **Fear of rejection** | Avoidance, awkwardness, or overcorrection into aggression |
| **Can't read cues** | Missing signals of interest or discomfort |
| **Performance mode** | Trying to be impressive instead of genuine |
| **Unrealistic expectations** | Porn, media, Instagram vs. real connection |

### How the App Can Help

**1. Normalize inexperience**
- Let them say "I'm new to this" without shame
- Match with patient partners or fellow beginners
- Set realistic expectations for early dates

**2. Model healthy communication**
- The app's voice demonstrates what respectful interaction sounds like
- Prompts that teach: "Here's one way to express that..."
- Never manipulative framing — connection, not conquest

**3. Low-pressure date structures**
- Suggest activity-based first dates (walk, coffee, museum)
- Time-bounded: "30-minute coffee" feels safer than "dinner"
- Public, casual, easy to exit gracefully

**4. Post-date coaching** (via feedback system)
- "The conversation felt awkward? That's normal. Here's what can help..."
- "You mentioned she seemed distant — here's how to check in without pressure"
- Gentle correction without judgment

**5. Celebrate effort, not outcomes**
- "You showed up and tried — that's the hard part"
- "Rejection isn't about your worth"
- Progress is dates happening, not just matches converting

**6. Counter toxic narratives**
- Frame dating as mutual discovery, not winning/losing
- Women are people with their own preferences, not puzzles to solve
- Vulnerability is attractive, not weak

### Questions That Help Young Men Develop

Instead of asking what they know (they don't), ask questions that prompt growth:

- "What kind of person do you want to be in a relationship?" (aspirational)
- "Think of a couple you admire. What do you notice about how they treat each other?"
- "What's something you're working on in yourself?" (growth orientation)
- "What would you want a partner to know about you that most people don't see?"

---

## Helping Young Women

Young women face different but related challenges.

### The Problems

| Issue | How It Shows Up |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Overwhelmed by attention** | Too many matches, hard to filter |
| **Safety concerns** | Real fear of meeting strangers |
| **Pressure to be nice** | Difficulty setting boundaries, saying no |
| **Mixed signals about what they want** | Social pressure vs. actual desires |
| **Performing femininity** | Being what they think men want |

### How the App Can Help

**1. Quality over quantity**
- Fewer, better matches based on compatibility
- Not a numbers game

**2. Safety built in**
- Activity-based, public first dates
- Time-limited meetings
- Easy ways to exit (future feature: check-in texts)

**3. Encourage honesty about wants**
- "It's okay to want something casual"
- "It's okay to want something serious"
- No judgment either way

**4. Model boundary-setting**
- "You can say no"
- "You don't owe anyone a second date"
- "Trust your gut"

## Communication Style as Signal

How someone responds tells us as much as what they say:

| Response Style | What It Suggests | Match With |
|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Long, detailed, reflective | Deep processor, values thoroughness | Similar or appreciates depth |
| Short, direct, action-oriented | Efficient, gets to the point | Similar or balances with depth |
| Playful, uses humor | Light touch, doesn't take self too seriously | Similar energy |
| Asks clarifying questions | Thoughtful, wants to get it right | Appreciates intentionality |
| Skips or "I don't know" | May not prioritize this, or still figuring out | Flexible partners |

We should be transparent: "How you answer helps us understand how you communicate."

---

## Scoring Model

Each dimension has three components:

```typescript
interface DimensionScore {
  formation: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4  // How developed is this response?
  position: number              // Where on the spectrum (-2 to +2)
  importance: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3     // How much does this matter to them?
}
```

**Formation levels:**
- 0 = No input (skipped)
- 1 = Minimal (one word, vague)
- 2 = Partial (some detail)
- 3 = Formed (clear perspective)
- 4 = Highly formed (nuanced, specific examples)

**Position:** Where they fall on the dimension's spectrum (varies by dimension)

**Importance:** Inferred from response depth, emotion words, emphasis

---

## Compatibility Logic

| Type | Rule | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| **Similarity** | Same position = high score | Values alignment |
| **Compatibility** | Works together, not necessarily same | Introvert + ambivert |
| **Complementary** | Different but balancing | Planner + flexible |
| **Dealbreaker** | Must match or no match | Children intent |

---

# Core Questions (Small, High-Quality Set)

We don't need dozens of questions. We need a few good ones that open conversation.

## The Essential Five (Onboarding)

**Two tracks based on experience level:**

### Track A: New to Dating

Concrete, scenario-based, low pressure:

1. **"What do you like doing for fun?"**
   - Reveals: Energy, interests, lifestyle
   - Simple, no wrong answer

2. **"What are you looking for?"** (choice)
   - Options: Something casual / Open to whatever / Something serious / Still figuring it out
   - Direct ask, validates uncertainty

3. **"After a long week, do you want to see people or be alone?"**
   - Reveals: Social energy
   - Binary makes it easy

4. **"Plans change last minute — are you relieved or annoyed?"**
   - Reveals: Spontaneity
   - Concrete reaction, not abstract preference

5. **"How much relationship experience do you have?"** (choice)
   - Options: Pretty new to this / Some but still learning / I know what I'm looking for
   - Calibrates future questions, normalizes inexperience

### Track B: More Experienced

These get us enough to start matching with depth:

1. **"What does your ideal weekend look like?"**
   - Reveals: Energy, social style, activity preference
   - Follow-up: "Is there another way you'd describe how you like to spend your time?"

2. **"What are you looking for right now?"**
   - Reveals: Intent, timeline, openness
   - Direct ask is fine here

3. **"What does trust look like to you?"**
   - Reveals: Trust style, what they're sensitive to
   - Follow-up: "What does it feel like when trust is broken?"

4. **"How do you feel when plans change last minute?"**
   - Reveals: Spontaneity, flexibility, need for structure
   - Follow-up: "Is that something you've always felt, or has it changed?"

5. **"What do you need when things get hard?"**
   - Reveals: Support style, communication needs, independence
   - Follow-up: "What doesn't help, even when people mean well?"

---

## Deepening Questions (Drip Over Time)

One per day, optional, after onboarding:

- **"What's a conversation you've had that really stuck with you?"** (communication depth)
- **"What does healthy space look like in a relationship?"** (independence vs togetherness)
- **"Tell me about a disagreement that ended well."** (conflict style)
- **"How do you feel about where work fits in your life?"** (career priority)
- **"What's something about yourself you've worked on changing?"** (growth orientation)

---

## Always Offer an Out

After any question:
- "Is there another way you think about this?"
- "Feel free to describe it differently"
- "Skip if this doesn't resonate"

Some users will surprise us with perspectives we didn't anticipate. That's valuable data too.

---

# High-Signal Questions

Some questions reveal more about compatibility than others. These are candidates for the "essential few" that might predict relationship success:

## The Hypothesis

A small subset of questions may be disproportionately predictive. We should track which questions correlate with:
- Mutual "see again" after dates
- Relationship duration
- User-reported satisfaction

## Candidate High-Signal Questions

### Growth & Respect
**"Has a partner ever helped you change your mind on something you believed?"**
- Reveals: Openness to growth, respect for partner's perspective, intellectual humility
- Why it matters: Shows they can be influenced by someone they love without feeling threatened
- Red flag if: "No one's ever changed my mind" or "I don't let people influence me"

**"What's something about yourself you've worked on changing?"**
- Reveals: Self-awareness, growth orientation, humility
- Why it matters: People who've done inner work tend to be better partners

### Conflict & Repair
**"Tell me about a disagreement that ended well. What made it work?"**
- Reveals: Conflict style, repair ability, emotional maturity
- Why it matters: All couples fight; repair ability predicts longevity

**"What happens in arguments that makes things worse?"**
- Reveals: Self-awareness about triggers, what they need to avoid

### Trust & Security
**"What does trust look like to you?"** + **"What does mistrust feel like?"**
- Reveals: Trust style AND what breaks it
- Why it matters: Mismatched trust languages cause invisible friction

### Independence & Togetherness
**"What does healthy space look like in a relationship?"**
- Reveals: Independence needs, attachment patterns
- Why it matters: Mismatch here causes "suffocating" vs "abandoned" feelings

### Support Style
**"What do you need when things get hard?"** + **"What doesn't help, even when people mean well?"**
- Reveals: How to support them, what to avoid
- Why it matters: Partners who know how to support each other last longer

# Compatibility Calculation

## Per-Dimension Scoring

```typescript
function dimensionCompatibility(a: DimensionScore, b: DimensionScore, rule: CompatibilityRule): number {
  // If either has no input, return neutral
  if (a.formation === 0 || b.formation === 0) return 50

  // Higher formation = more confident score
  const confidence = Math.min(a.formation, b.formation) / 4

  let baseScore: number

  switch (rule) {
    case 'similarity':
      // Same position = 100, each step apart = -25
      const diff = Math.abs(a.position - b.position)
      baseScore = Math.max(0, 100 - (diff * 25))
      break

    case 'compatibility':
      // Within 2 = good, 3 = okay, 4 = poor
      const distance = Math.abs(a.position - b.position)
      baseScore = distance <= 2 ? 100 - (distance * 15) : 30
      break

    case 'complementary':
      // Opposite can be good, same can be good
      baseScore = 70 // Most combinations work
      break

    case 'dealbreaker':
      // Must match or fail
      baseScore = a.position === b.position ? 100 : 0
      break
  }

  // Weight by importance (if one cares a lot, weight heavier)
  const importanceWeight = Math.max(a.importance, b.importance) / 3

  return baseScore * (0.5 + (confidence * 0.3) + (importanceWeight * 0.2))
}
```

## Overall Match Score

```typescript
interface MatchScore {
  lifestyle: number      // 0-100
  values: number         // 0-100
  psychology: number     // 0-100 (if opted in)
  feedback: number       // 0-100 (if available)
  overall: number        // Weighted combination
  confidence: string     // "low" | "medium" | "high"
  dealbreakers: string[] // Any failed dealbreaker checks
}

function calculateMatch(a: Profile, b: Profile): MatchScore {
  // Check dealbreakers first
  const dealbreakers = checkDealbreakers(a, b)
  if (dealbreakers.length > 0) {
    return { overall: 0, dealbreakers, confidence: 'high' }
  }

  const lifestyle = averageScore([
    dimensionCompatibility(a.schedule, b.schedule, 'similarity'),
    dimensionCompatibility(a.energy, b.energy, 'similarity'),
    dimensionCompatibility(a.social, b.social, 'compatibility'),
    dimensionCompatibility(a.spontaneity, b.spontaneity, 'complementary'),
    dimensionCompatibility(a.location, b.location, 'compatibility'),
  ])

  const values = averageScore([
    dimensionCompatibility(a.trust, b.trust, 'similarity'),
    dimensionCompatibility(a.communication, b.communication, 'similarity'),
    dimensionCompatibility(a.conflict, b.conflict, 'compatibility'),
    dimensionCompatibility(a.independence, b.independence, 'compatibility'),
    dimensionCompatibility(a.growth, b.growth, 'similarity'),
    dimensionCompatibility(a.career, b.career, 'compatibility'),
  ])

  const psychology = a.psychOptedIn && b.psychOptedIn
    ? averageScore([
        dimensionCompatibility(a.attachment, b.attachment, 'compatibility'),
        dimensionCompatibility(a.expression, b.expression, 'compatibility'),
        dimensionCompatibility(a.novelty, b.novelty, 'complementary'),
      ])
    : null

  const overall = calculateOverall(lifestyle, values, psychology)
  const confidence = calculateConfidence(a, b)

  return { lifestyle, values, psychology, overall, confidence, dealbreakers: [] }
}
```

# Feedback System

## Post-Date Feedback

After meeting, both people answer:

**Question 1:** "How did it feel to spend time with them?"
- Easy and natural
- Good but took some warming up
- A bit awkward
- Not a fit

**Question 2:** "Anything stand out?" (optional text)

**Question 3:** "Would you see them again?"
- Definitely
- Maybe
- Probably not

## Feedback Aggregation

After 3+ interactions, patterns emerge:

```typescript
interface FeedbackProfile {
  easeScore: number      // How easy to be around (0-100)
  authenticityScore: number  // Were they who they seemed? (0-100)
  reliabilityScore: number   // Did they show up, on time? (0-100)

  positivePatterns: string[] // "Good listener", "Easy to talk to"
  concernPatterns: string[]  // "Ran late", "Different than profile"

  responseCount: number
}
```

## Showing Feedback to Users

**What they see (gentle, aggregated):**

```
People who've met you often mention:
✓ Easy to talk to
✓ Good energy

Something to know:
○ A couple people mentioned you ran late
```

**Rules:**
- Only show after 3+ similar signals
- Lead with positives
- Frame concerns as "something to know" not criticism
- Never show individual feedback

---

# Progressive Questioning

Don't ask everything at once. Questions should evolve as users gain experience.

## Onboarding (5 min)

Based on experience level (see Track A / Track B above):

**Everyone:**
1. Location (direct)
2. Basic info (age, photos)
3. Experience level question

**New users (Track A):**
- Concrete scenario questions
- Simple either/or choices
- No pressure to have "figured it out"

**Experienced users (Track B):**
- Reflective questions
- Follow-ups welcome
- Nuance appreciated

## Week 1-2 (Scenario Drip)

**New users:** One scenario question per day
- "Your date is running 20 min late and hasn't texted. What's your first thought?"
- "You've been texting someone for a week. They suggest meeting up. How do you feel?"
- "After a great first date, how soon do you want to hear from them?"

**Experienced users:** One reflective question per day
- Communication style
- Independence vs togetherness
- Conflict style
- Growth orientation
- Career priority

## After First Match

Context makes questions meaningful:
- "What are you hoping happens?"
- "Anything you're curious about them?"
- "Anything you're nervous about?"

## After First Date

Real experience to learn from:

**Feedback questions:**
- How did it feel?
- Would you see them again?
- Anything stand out?

**Learning questions:**
- "What surprised you?"
- "What did you notice about yourself?"
- "Anything you'd do differently?"

**For new users, add coaching:**
- "First dates can feel awkward — that's totally normal"
- "Here's what often helps the second time..."

## After Multiple Dates

Now abstract questions make sense:
- "What's working in dates that go well?"
- "What patterns do you notice in what attracts you?"
- "What does trust mean to you now that you've experienced more?"

## Ongoing (Monthly Check-in)

As users gain experience:
- "Has anything changed in what you're looking for?"
- "What have you learned about yourself?"
- Unlock deeper questions as formation scores increase

# Matching Considerations for Inexperienced Users

## The Sparse Data Problem

New users have less data. This affects matching:

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Few dimensions scored | Match on what we have, lower confidence |
| Low formation scores | Weight those dimensions less |
| "I don't know" answers | Treat as neutral, not negative |
| Scenario answers | Extract position even without reflection |

## Matching New with Experienced

Should a 19-year-old with no relationship experience match with a 28-year-old who knows exactly what they want?

**Arguments for:**
- Experienced partners can be patient teachers
- Some people prefer partners who are "fresh"
- Age isn't the same as experience

**Arguments against:**
- Power imbalance risk
- Frustration when communication styles differ
- Different life stages

**Approach:** Let users indicate preference:
- "I prefer someone at a similar experience level"
- "Experience level doesn't matter to me"
- "I'd prefer someone more experienced who can be patient"

- **Activity-based:** Walking, coffee shop, museum
- **Time-bounded:** "30-minute coffee" not "dinner"
- **Public:** Easy to exit, feels safer
- **Daytime:** Less romantic pressure
