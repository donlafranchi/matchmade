# /design/

Specs still being developed. Not ready for implementation.

Agents should NOT implement from here. PM moves to dev/backlog/ when ready.

## Workflow

1. PM creates design spec here
2. Spec is refined and reviewed
3. When ready, PM moves to dev/backlog/
4. Agent picks up from backlog, moves to dev/tickets/

## What Goes Here

- Feature specifications in progress
- Architecture explorations
- API design drafts
- UI/UX mockup descriptions

## File Naming

`[feature-name].md` - e.g., `premium-subscriptions.md`, `event-matching.md`
