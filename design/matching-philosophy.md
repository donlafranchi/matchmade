## The Hierarchy of Relationship Duration

Three core layers determine how long relationships last:

| Layer | What It Predicts | Duration |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| **Attraction alone** | Initial spark | Short term |
| **Attraction + Lifestyle** | Can spend time together | Medium term |
| **Attraction + Lifestyle + Values** | Long-term alignment | Long term |

### Why This Order Matters

1. **Attraction** gets you in the door - you need it to start
2. **Lifestyle** is ironically critical - most overlooked factor; determines if you can actually date
3. **Values** determine if you last - what keeps people together long-term

## Filters vs Layers

**Decency and Psychology are filters, not hierarchy layers:**

| Filter | Purpose | Analogy |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Decency** | Safety check | Like breathing - necessary but not what makes relationships last |
| **Psychology** | Readiness filter | Helps filter who's ready; nice-to-have depth |

## Core Matching Principles

### 1. Chemistry Is Discovered, Not Predicted
The system doesn't promise chemistry. It creates conditions where chemistry has room to emerge. Meeting in person is where you find out if you actually click.

### 2. Lifestyle Compatibility Is Critical
Most overlooked factor. Two people can have great values alignment but incompatible schedules, energy levels, or living situations.

### 3. Decency Is Tracked Through Real Behavior
Not self-reported. We observe how people behave at events and through feedback from others.

### 4. Progressive Profiling
Depth unlocks access, filters naturally. Users who share more get better matches.

### 5. Match on Compatible Patterns
Not checkbox overlap. Two people who both checked "loves hiking" isn't compatibility. Understanding why they value outdoor time is.

## Matching Formula (Conceptual)

```
matchScore = attraction × (decency + lifestyle + values)

Where:
- attraction: Mutual physical interest (binary gate)
- decency: Safety/trust score (0-1, must be above threshold)
- lifestyle: Day-to-day compatibility (0-100)
- values: Long-term alignment (0-100)
```

### Progressive Unlocking

| Phase | What's Calculated | User Journey |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | Attraction only | Week 1-2 |
| Phase 2 | Attraction × Lifestyle | Week 3-4 |
| Phase 3 | Attraction × (Decency + Lifestyle) | Week 5-6 |
| Phase 4 | Full formula with Values | Month 2 |
| Phase 5 | Psychology modifiers | Month 3-4 |

## Psychological Modifiers (Future)

Once we have psychological depth:

- **familiarityBoost:** Attraction to patterns that feel familiar (not always healthy)
- **longTermConcern:** Flags for patterns that might cause problems later
- **growthEdge:** Where someone is actively working on themselves

---

## Mysterious Insights

Instead of showing raw compatibility scores, surface mysterious hints:

- "Someone here shares your energy level"
- "You both value the same thing in conflict"
- "They're navigating something similar to you"

This preserves discovery while signaling compatibility.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Checkbox matching:** "You both like hiking" means nothing
2. **Premature optimization:** Don't over-filter before people meet
3. **False precision:** Don't pretend 87% compatibility means anything specific
4. **Ignoring attraction:** Values alignment without attraction doesn't work
5. **Ignoring values:** Attraction without values alignment burns out fast
